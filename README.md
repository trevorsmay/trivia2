# Monty Python Holy Grail Trivia!

This application is a game that allows you to answer these questions three to see if you are permitted to pass the Bridge of Death! The game follows the movie and who knows if you'll answer the questions correctly or if you'll be cast off the bridge to your doom. Good Luck!
